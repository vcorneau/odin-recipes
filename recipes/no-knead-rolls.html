    <h2>Buns in 4 hours. It's not quicker than the grocery store, but it is cheaper.</h2>
    <h3>Use an oven thermometer to make sure the oven is hot enough</h3>
    <p>Ingredients: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>300-325 g bread flour</li>
        <li>1 g dry active yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup hot tap water (up to 130 F)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl combine dry ingredients. Stir in water. Mixture will be thick and sticky.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap & let stand on counter top for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>After 3 hours (mixture will be puffy and bubbly on top) place dough on a well-floured surface. Using a scraper fold over about 12 times, adding enough flour so it doesn’t stick (about 2 Tbsp).</li>
        <li>Using a scraper cut dough into 8 pieces. With floured hands, shape each into a ball by folding and tucking, like making a drawstring bag.</li>
        <li>Place on parchment paper-lined baking sheet (not wax paper) & cover with a dish towel. Let stand at room temperature for 35 minutes. They will puff up but will not double in size.</li>
        <li>As soon as rolls are covered, start preheating oven to 450° F. Oven must be 450° so use an oven thermometer if possible.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. To re-crisp the next day, preheat the oven to 325° F and place the rolls directly on the oven rack for 10-12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
